As the PC uses their action against each chest:
	- a box comes out with each picture in it
		- maybe have them leave a comment? or see my comment and then leave one?
		- maybe compare them to a comic stip? and then have them leave a CAPTION?
		- ask them a trivia question
			- if they get it correct, they see another picture?
As they "attack" each chest
	- Have multiple photos
